1. Upcoming Trips List (Assigned by Fleet Owner)
Create a new section called “My Upcoming Trips”.
The trips will be pushed from the backend by the driver’s owner or fleet manager.
The driver should simply see a list of upcoming trips in sequence, like:

Trip 1 → Tomorrow, 7 AM

Trip 2 → Day after tomorrow, 9 AM

Each trip card should show:

Start point (icon only)

End point (icon only)

Number of delivery points (e.g., 12 stops)

Simple visual timeline

Trip date & time

Make it pictorial and extremely easy to understand.

2. Trip Details → Delivery Points View

When the driver clicks any trip, open a dedicated Trip Details screen.

It must show:

All delivery points in that trip

Optimized in the correct order

Shown mostly using icons, pictures, large numbers

Minimal text

Big tappable boxes for each delivery point

Make the list feel like a story flow:
Stop 1 → Stop 2 → Stop 3 → … (up to 10–20 stops)

Each stop should show:

A small picture or symbol of the destination type (warehouse, shop, factory, home delivery, etc.)

Address in small text (optional)

“Navigate” button

3. Animated Map (Google Maps–Style Start Navigation)

When the driver taps Start Trip, a new screen should appear that looks and behaves like Google Maps Navigation:

A live moving map

All delivery points visible as pins

Pins appear in the optimized order

A big arrow showing driver movement

Turn-by-turn guidance style visuals

Simple animations (e.g., bouncing pins, highlighted current stop)

Driver should always see the next stop highlighted

Think of this as “Google Maps for multi-stop trucking”, but simplified visually for drivers.

4. Auto-Move to Next Delivery Point

After reaching a stop, the app should automatically:

Mark stop as completed

Move to the next delivery point

Update the route visually

Show a small tick mark animation for completed stops

Make it feel smooth and visual.

5. Sample Data for Demo

For the demo, please create two sample trips:

Trip 1: 5–10 delivery points (within one city)

Trip 2: 10–20 delivery points (dense, urban routing)

Make sure each trip loads correctly, shows all stops, and flows visually like real-world navigation.
